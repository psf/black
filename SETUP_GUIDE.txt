# Mutation Adequacy Assignment: Setup Guide

Follow these steps to ensure the test suite passes and to set up mutation testing.

## 1. Environment & Config Fixes (One-time Setup)

Run these commands in the project root to fix the test configuration (ignoring deprecation warnings):

```bash
sed -i '' 's/filterwarnings = \["error"\]/filterwarnings = ["ignore::DeprecationWarning"]/g' pyproject.toml
```

## 2. Running the Baseline Tests

We must ensure all tests pass before starting mutation.

Run tests using this command:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src && ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest --ignore=mutants
```

*Note: The `export PYTHONPATH` part is required because the editable install is not being picked up correctly by this preview version of Python.*

**Expected Output:**
You should see ~418 passed tests and 0 failures.
