# Contributing to *Black*

Welcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better. Have you
read the entire [user documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
yet?


## Bird's eye view

In terms of inspiration, *Black* is about as configurable as *gofmt*.
This is deliberate.

Bug reports and fixes are always welcome!  Please follow the [issue
template on GitHub](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/new) for best 
results.

Before you suggest a new feature or configuration knob, ask yourself why
you want it.  If it enables better integration with some workflow, fixes
an inconsistency, speeds things up, and so on - go for it!  On the other
hand, if your answer is "because I don't like a particular formatting"
then you're not ready to embrace *Black* yet. Such changes are unlikely
to get accepted. You can still try but prepare to be disappointed.


## Technicalities

Development on the latest version of Python is preferred.  As of this
writing it's 3.8. You can use any operating system.  I am using macOS
myself and CentOS at work.

Install all development dependencies using:
```
$ pipenv install --dev
$ pipenv shell
$ pre-commit install
```
If you haven't used `pipenv` before but are comfortable with virtualenvs,
just run `pip install pipenv` in the virtualenv you're already using and
invoke the command above from the cloned *Black* repo. It will do the
correct thing.

Before submitting pull requests, run tests with:
```
$ python setup.py test
```


## Hygiene

If you're fixing a bug, add a test.  Run it first to confirm it fails,
then fix the bug, run it again to confirm it's really fixed.

If adding a new feature, add a test.  In fact, always add a test.  But
wait, before adding any large feature, first open an issue for us to
discuss the idea first.


## Finally

Thanks again for your interest in improving the project!  You're taking
action when most people decide to sit and watch.
