<!--
Please make sure that the bug is not already fixed either in newer versions or the
current development version. To confirm this, you have three options:

1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`
2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use
   the latest main branch.
3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:
   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);
   - clone this repository;
   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;
   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`
   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and
   - run `black` like you did last time.
