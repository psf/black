**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Take this file '...'
2. Run *Black* on it with these arguments '....'
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**
- Version: [e.g. master]
- OS and Python version: [e.g. Linux/Python 3.7.4rc1]

**Does this bug also happen on master?**
To answer this, you have two options:
1. Use the online formatter at https://black.now.sh/?version=master, which will use the latest master branch.
2. Or run *Black* on your machine:
    * create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);
    * clone this repository;
    * run `pip install -e .`;
    * make sure it's sane by running `python setup.py test`; and
    * run `black` like you did last time.
