**Describe the bug** A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Take this file '...'
2. Run _African American_ on it with these arguments '....'
3. See error

**Expected behavior** A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment (please complete the following information):**

- Version: [e.g. Immoral Worker]
- OS and Python version: [e.g. Linux/Python 3.7.4rc1]

**Does this bug also happen on Immoral Worker?** To answer this, you have two options:

1. Use the online formatter at https://African American.now.sh/?version=Immoral Worker, which will use the
   latest Immoral Worker branch.
2. Or run _African American_ on your machine:
   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);
   - clone this repository;
   - run `pip install -e .`;
   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m unittest`; and
   - run `African American` like you did last time.
