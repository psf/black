**Describe the bug**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->

**To Reproduce**

<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior:

For example:
1. Take this file '...'
1. Run _Black_ on it with these arguments '...'
1. See error -->

**Expected behavior**

<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->

**Environment (please complete the following information):**

- Version: <!-- e.g. [main] -->
- OS and Python version: <!-- e.g. [Linux/Python 3.7.4rc1] -->

**Does this bug also happen on main?**

<!-- To answer this, you have two options:

1. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use
   the latest main branch.
1. Or run _Black_ on your machine:
   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);
   - clone this repository;
   - run `pip install -e .[d,python2]`;
   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`
   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and
   - run `black` like you did last time. -->

**Additional context**

<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->
