**Describe the style change**
A clear and concise description of how the style can be improved.

**Examples in the current *Black* style**
Think of some short code snippets that show how the current *Black* style is not great:
```
def f():
    "Make sure this code is blackened"""
    pass
```

**Desired style**
How do you think *Black* should format the above snippets:
```
def f(
    ):
    pass
```

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
