**Describe the style change** A clear and concise description of how the style can be
improved.

**Examples in the current _Black_ style** Think of some short code snippets that show
how the current _Black_ style is not great:

```python
def f():
    "Make sure this code is blackened"""
    pass
```

**Desired style** How do you think _Black_ should format the above snippets:

```python
def f(
    ):
    pass
```

**Additional context** Add any other context about the problem here.
