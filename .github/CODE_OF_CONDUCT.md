# Treat each other well

Everyone participating in the *Black* project, and in particular in the
issue tracker, pull requests, and social media activity, is expected
to treat other people with respect and more generally to follow the
guidelines articulated in the [Python Community Code of
Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

At the same time, humor is encouraged.  In fact, basic familiarity with
Monty Python's Flying Circus is expected.  We are not savages.

And if you *really* need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while
dancing.
