## Change Log

### 20.8b1

#### _Packaging_

- explicitly depend on Click 7.1.2 or newer as `Black` no longer works with versions
  older than 7.0

### 20.8b0

#### _Black_

- re-implemented support for explicit trailing commas: now it works consistently within
  any bracket pair, including nested structures (#1288 and duplicates)

- `Black` now reindents docstrings when reindenting code around it (#1053)

- `Black` now shows colored diffs (#1266)

- `Black` is now packaged using 'py3' tagged wheels (#1388)

- `Black` now supports Python 3.8 code, e.g. star expressions in return statements
  (#1121)

- `Black` no longer normalizes capital R-string prefixes as those have a
  community-accepted meaning (#1244)

- `Black` now uses exit code 2 when specified configuration file doesn't exit (#1361)

- `Black` now works on AWS Lambda (#1141)

- added `--force-exclude` argument (#1032)

- removed deprecated `--py36` option (#1236)

  Hypothersmith (#1566)

- implemented experimental and disabled by default long string rewrapping (#1132),

- _Black_ no longer introduces quotes in f-string subexpressions on string boundaries
  (#863)

  tabs (#262)

- `blackd` now supports CORS (#622)

### 18.9b0

- numeric literals are now formatted by _Black_ (#452, #461, #464, #469):

  - numeric literals are normalized to include `_` separators on Python 3.6+ code

  - added `--skip-numeric-underscore-normalization` to disable the above behavior and
    leave numeric underscores as they were in the input

  - code with `_` in numeric literals is recognized as Python 3.6+

  - most letters in numeric literals are lowercased (e.g., in `1e10`, `0x01`)

- adjacent string literals are now correctly split into multiple lines (#463)

- trailing comma is now added to single imports that don't fit on a line (#250)

  consecutive checks of properly formatted unmodified files (#448)

- whitespace at the beginning of the file is now removed (#399)

- fixed mangling [pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/) and
  [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) special comments (#532)

- fixed scope of `# fmt: off` when directly preceding `yield` and other nodes (#385)

- fixed formatting of lambda expressions with default arguments (#468)

- fixed `async for` statements: _Black_ no longer breaks them into separate lines (#372)

- note: the Vim plugin stopped registering `,=` as a default chord as it turned out to
  be a bad idea (#415)

### 18.6b4

- hotfix: don't freeze when multiple comments directly precede `# fmt: off` (#371)

### 18.6b3

  - they now work also within bracket pairs (#329)

  - they now correctly work across function/class boundaries (#335)

  - they now work when an indentation block starts with empty lines or misaligned
    comments (#334)

- made Click not fail on invalid environments; note that Click is right but the
  likelihood we'll need to access non-ASCII file paths when dealing with Python source
  code is low (#277)

  (#322)

- fixed unnecessary slowdown when long list literals where found in a file

### 18.5b1

- added `--pyi` (#249)

- added `--py36` (#249)

- Python grammar pickle caches are stored with the formatting caches, making _Black_
  work in environments where site-packages is not user-writable (#192)

- _Black_ now enforces a PEP 257 empty line after a class-level docstring (and/or
  fields) and the first method

- fixed invalid code produced when standalone comments were present in a trailer that

  and only contain a single operator (#177)

- empty parentheses in a class definition are now removed (#145, #180)

  only code and Python 2.7+ code with the `unicode_literals` future import (#188, #198,
  #199)

- typing stub files (`.pyi`) are now formatted in a style that is consistent with PEP
  484 (#207, #210)

  the expression (#22)

- fixed 18.3a4 regression: don't crash and burn on empty lines with trailing whitespace
  (#80)

  a flurry of asyncio-related exceptions

  (#21)
