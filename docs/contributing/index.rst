Welcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better. Have you read the entire
`user documentation <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ yet?

.. rubric:: Bird's eye view

In terms of inspiration, *Black* is about as configurable as *gofmt*. This is
deliberate.

Bug reports and fixes are always welcome! Please follow the
`issue template on GitHub <https://github.com/psf/black/issues/new>`_ for best results.

Before you suggest a new feature or configuration knob, ask yourself why you want it. If
it enables better integration with some workflow, fixes an inconsistency, speeds things
up, and so on - go for it! On the other hand, if your answer is "because I don't like a
particular formatting" then you're not ready to embrace *Black* yet. Such changes are
unlikely to get accepted. You can still try but prepare to be disappointed.
