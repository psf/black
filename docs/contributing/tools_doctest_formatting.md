    >>> isinstance(get_current_time(), str)
    True

    doctest.testmod()




# Explanation

Explanation
Before isort: The imports were unordered.

Running isort: The command isort example.py sorts the imports alphabetically and ensures they are structured logically.

After isort: The imports are now organized in a consistent manner.

Using isort helps maintain clean and organized import statements, making your code more readable and easier to manage. Additionally, this ensures that any doctest sections remain clear and consistent with the rest of your code. If you need any more help or have further questions, feel free to ask!
