Black
=====

**Black** is the uncompromising Python code formatter. 

By using *Black*, you
agree to cease control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return,
*Black* gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from `pycodestyle`
nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for
more important matters.

*Black* makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs
possible. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project
you're reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you
can focus on the content instead.

.. note::

   Black is an early pre-release.
