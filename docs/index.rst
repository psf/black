The uncompromising code formatter
=================================

By using *Black*, you agree to cede control over minutiae of
hand-formatting. In return, *Black* gives you speed, determinism, and
freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time
and mental energy for more important matters.

*Black* makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs
possible. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project
you're reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you
can focus on the content instead.

Try it out now using the `Black Playground <https://black.now.sh>`_.

.. note::

   `Black is beta <installation_and_usage.html#note-this-is-a-beta-product>`_.
