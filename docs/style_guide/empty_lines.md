# Empty lines

## Emit extra empty line after control flow statements

*Black* will always emit an extra empty line after ``return``, ``raise``, 
``break``, ``continue``, and ``yield``.

## Allow single empty lines inside functions

## Allow single and double empty lines at module level

Single and double empty lines on module level left by the original editors,
except when they're within parenthesized expressions. 

## Ensure empty lines before and after function definitions

- one line before and after inner functions
- two lines before and after module-level functions.  

## Use docstring instead of standalone comments before a function

Empty lines placed between the function definition and any standalone comments
that immediately precede the given function.

## Original

TODO: add an original and after black for this item

## After *Black*

TODO: add an original and after black for this item

If you want to comment on the entire function, use a docstring or put a 
leading comment in the function body.
