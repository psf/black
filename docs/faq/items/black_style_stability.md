# How stable is Black's style?

Quite. _Black_ aims to enforce one style and one style only, with some room for
pragmatism. However, _Black_ is still in beta so style changes are both planned and
still proposed on the issue tracker. See
[The Black Code Style](../../the_black_code_style/index.rst) for more details.
