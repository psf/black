# Does Black support Python 2?

For formatting, yes! [Install](../../getting_started.md#installation) with the `python2`
extra to format Python 2 files too! There are no current plans to drop support, but most
likely it is bound to happen. Sometime. Eventually. In terms of running _Black_ though,
Python 3.6 or newer is required.
