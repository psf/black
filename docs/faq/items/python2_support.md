# Does Black support Python 2?

By default, no. [Install](../../getting_started.md#installation) with the `python2`
extra to format Python 2 files too! There are no current plans to drop support, but most
likely it is bound to happen. Sometime. Eventually. In terms of running _Black_, at
least Python 3.6 is required though.
