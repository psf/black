u'"Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne\'s World is a wacky, irreverent pop culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne\'s basement, the pair broadcast a talk show called \\\\"Wayne\'s World\\\\" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big budget version of \\\\"Wayne\'s World\\\\" and he also wants Wayne\'s girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast as well as the wild pop culture references make Wayne\'s World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin off movie.\\\\n"'
